Installation methods: Options include:
Dual boot with Windows
Running Linux inside a virtual machine (like VirtualBox)
Live USB for a temporary environment
Installation steps: Boot from USB, partition disks, and complete the guided setup.
3. Understanding the Linux File System
Directory structure overview:
/home: Personal directories for each user.
/etc: Configuration files for the system and installed services.
